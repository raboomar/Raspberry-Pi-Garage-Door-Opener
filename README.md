# Garage Door Opener with Raspberry Pi

The Garage Door Opener project is designed to enable you to check the status of your garage door and open or close it remotely using your mobile phone. This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi and incorporates both backend and frontend technologies. The backend is built using Python Flask, while the front end is developed using React.js. Additionally, port forwarding was implemented to allow remote access to the Raspberry Pi, as it was initially only accessible within the local network.

## Features

- Check the status of your garage door from anywhere using your mobile phone.
- Open or close the garage door remotely using the web interface.
- Secure authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the system.
- Real-time updates on the web interface to reflect the current status of the garage door.
- Easy to set up and configure.

## Requirements

To set up this project, you will need the following:

- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- Raspberry Pi power supply
- Garage door opener with GPIO compatibility
- Internet connection
- Mobile phone or computer to access the web interface
